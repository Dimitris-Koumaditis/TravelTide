# TravelTide Project:

TravelTide, an e-booking business, is a popular new participant in the internet travel sector. It has grown steadily since its inception during the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04), owing to its best-in-class data gathering and search technologies. According to consumer comments and industry analysts, TravelTide users have access to the greatest travel inventory available in the e-booking arena.
Following the startup pattern, TravelTide has kept a laser focus on gaining an unfair edge in a restricted number of dimensions - in this case, creating the largest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this focused emphasis, several areas of the TravelTide client experience remain undeveloped, resulting in low customer retention.

## Project Description:

This project seeks to evaluate consumer behavior and preferences in order to determine the most appealing incentive or perk for each customer segment. It entails analyzing client data, generating various indices, segmenting consumers, and selecting appropriate incentives for each segment. The study also investigates client demographics to adapt the benefits accordingly.

## Objective:

In this assignment, you will segment customer data depending on business requirements and then make data-driven suggestions based on your findings.

## Main Steps:

**Collecting Data:** Gathering customer data, including behavioral metrics and demographic information using SQL query.

**Calculations:** Calculating various indexes like Cancellation Rate, Hotel Discount Chasers, Average Bags, Discount Chasers, Combined Booking, and Session Intensity Index for each customer using SQL.

**Defining Perks:** Defining the most attractive perk for each customer based on their behavioral metrics and segment them into groups.

**Demographic Analysis:** Analyzing customer segments by demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, and parental status using Tableau.

**Visualization:** Creating visualizations in Tableau to present the findings and insights from the analysis.

**Recommendations:** Summarizing the project's goals, findings, and provide recommendations based on customer segmentation.
